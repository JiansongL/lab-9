Question 1:

	The denominations of the US coins from the green, blue and orange distributions are Cent, Nickel, and dollar respectively.Firstly, the variation of weights might be caused by the manufacturing process. Although the manufacturing process is standarized, the differences in the materials used or other unpricise production might contributed to the variations.Secondly, the natural wear and tear of coins could result in weight loss as each coin has been circulate in market for a long time. Lastly, the tolerance reason, the manufacturing process always set a certain amount of tolernace for coin production. If the weight of coin fall under the acceptable limit range, it will be generally produced and accepted to be same weight and denomination.
	I will first compare the weight of a coin to the database of known coin weights, which contains all the weights of different denominations of coins. If the weight of coin matches or it falls under the acceptable range of denomination, it will identified as the corresponding denomination of the coin. If the weight does not match, my vending machine will reject the coin.

	
Question 2:

	Light sensor


Question 3:
	Dataset A,C, and D are linearly separable because I can draw a single line in 2D to seperate the two classes of 
data points. All the points belonging to one class fall on one side of the line. 
	For dataset A, the classifier line could be y=-x+20
                For dataset C, the classifier line could be vertical (x=6.25)
                For dataset D, the classifier line could be y=-x+15

Question 4:
	Circular, elliptical, spherical, cylinderical , polynomial or parabolic boundary.

Question 5:
	The output is 1/(1+e^-4), which is approximately 1
